I plan on talking to the pediatrician and my midwife for additional information beyond the article written about it, especially since that is from 2008.

It probably is a tad spicy for the \"average\" palate but if you love spicy, give this a try.  When I have a stuffy nose, I even add a couple splashes of hot sauce or sriracha and it clears me right up.\\n',\n",

       " 'ReviewText: These are excellent inexpensive noodles but they are quite salty for someone who rarely adds salt to food, even when cooking, as I do!  They are more expensive than grocery store Ramen and taste a good deal better but seem to have about the same destructive amounts of salt- 2020 mg or about 80% daily salt intake/bag which claims to be 2 servings but I assume that most adults would consume the lot unless using this as only part of a meal rather than a quick comfort food.  Other reviews alerted me to this and following their recommendation, I only used 1/2 the soup base package.  I added some dehydrated green onions and dried oinions when preparing on the stovetop and added a fresh egg, covering it with the noodles after removing from the heat.  This had excellent flavor and with half of the salt, I did not feel like my blood pressure would be so imperiled as I had used the whole soup packet.  I like and regularly consume very spicy food (I frequently consume 4-5 jalapenos with a meal) but as prepared it was quite delicious and spicy enough.<br />  There are other brands of noodles that I frequently buy from Amazon <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BCE97K\">Annie Chun\\'s Korean Sweet Chili Noodle Bowl, 8.4-Ounce Units (Pack of 6)</a> that I relish but the salt is still high and the price is somewhat higher.  I will alternate varieties in the future.  I only eat Asian Noodles no more than once a week since I do have some sodium issues.<br />  I am on disability and do not get out often from my house in the country so I have tried many of the long shelf life foods that Amazon sells.  They sell many dehydrated vegetables in medium sized quantities that make them easy to have on hand and still be way cheaper than grocery store prices.  I even found some non refrigerated tofu <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTY7Y\">Mori-Nu Tofu, Lite, Silken, Firm, 12.3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> that I have received but not yet tried.  The customer reviews claim that it is excellent quality and it is actually cheaper than the fresh brand offered in the local grocery.  I expect to add some to my next bowl of noodles and the soups that I frequently make from scratch.\\n',\n",

Federal organic standards prohibit the use of all synthetic/petrochemical solvents\".<br /><br />Martek Biosciences was able to dodge the ban on hexane-extraction by claiming USDA does not consider omega-3 and omega-6 fats to be \"agricultural ingredients.\" Therefore, they argue, the ban against hexane extraction does not apply. The USDA helped them out by classifying those oils as \"necessary vitamins and minerals,\" which are exempt from the hexane ban. But hexane-extraction is just the tip of the iceberg. Other questionable manufacturing practices and misleading statements by Martek included:<br /><br />Undisclosed synthetic ingredients, prohibited for use in organics (including the sugar alcohol mannitol, modified starch, glucose syrup solids, and \"other\" undisclosed ingredients)<br />Microencapsulation of the powder and nanotechnology, which are prohibited under organic laws<br />Use of volatile synthetic solvents, besides hexane (such as isopropyl alcohol)<br />Recombinant DNA techniques and other forms of genetic modification of organisms; mutagenesis; use of GMO corn as a fermentation medium<br />Heavily processed ingredients that are far from \"natural\"<br /><br />quote from: Why is this Organic Food Stuffed With Toxic Solvents? by Dr. Mercola - GOOGLE GMOs found in Martek.<br /><br />This is the latest I have found on DHA in organic and non organic baby food/ formula:<br />AT LEAST READ THIS ONE*** GOOGLE- False Claims That DHA in Organic and Non-Organic Infant Formula Is Safe. AND OrganicconsumersDOTorg<br /><br />Martek\\'s patents for Life\\'sDHA states: \"includes mutant organisms\" and \"recombinant organisms\", (a.k.a. GMOs!) The patents explain that the oil is \"extracted readily with an effective amount of solvent ... a preferred solvent is hexane.\"<br /><br />The patent for Life\\'sARA states: \"genetically-engineering microorganisms to produce increased amounts of arachidonic acid\" and \"extraction with solvents such as ... hexane.\" Martek has many other patents for DHA and ARA. All of them include GMOs. GMOs and volatile synthetic solvents like hexane aren\\'t allowed in USDA Organic products and ingredients.<br /><br />Tragically, Martek\\'s Life\\'sDHA is already in hundreds of products, many of them certified USDA Organic. Please demand that the National Organic Standards Board reject Martek\\'s petition, and that the USDA National Organic Program inform the company that the illegal 2006 approval is rescinded and that their GMO, hexane-extracted Life\\'sDHA and Life\\'sARA are no longer allowed in organic products.<br /><br />BUT I went to the lifesdha website and THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE HOW THEY MAKE THEIR LifesDHA!!! I have contacted the company to see what they say.<br /><br />Also these are the corporate practices of Martek which are damaging to the environment as well written just last Dec 2011 at NaturalnewsDOTcom<br /><br />The best bet is to just avoid the lifeDHA at this time in my opinion b/c corporate america cares more about the almighty $ than your health.\\n',\n",

       " 'ReviewText: We breastfeed our month old boy, but since his bilirubin level was still high, doctors recommended to switch to formula for 48 hours. We started with Similac Advance (Shield Plus) which we still had from hospital. First 24 hours were wonderful in terms of pooping, then we decided to switch to Similac Organic for known reasons, but during the first 32-Ounce Bottle I began to notice that his stool was getting harder, and eventually he stopped pooing (actually he produced two stone-ball like poops) and had a hard time for another 24 hours. Breast milk and Similac advance tested similarly sweet, but Similac Organic was much much less sweet. I made a research on the internet and I found the following that may help you to understand the cause of constipation: (http://www.drhull.com/EncyMaster/C/constipation_infant.html)<br /><br />Constipation means infrequent, hard stools. It does not mean grunting or straining, although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement. So the first question to ask is, \"Is my child really constipated?\"<br /><br />Next, consider why true constipation - excessively hard, dry stools - arises. The normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool. Otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die. That is why severe diarrhea is dangerous - the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast, there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream.<br /><br />Conversely, if the fecal material remains in the colon too long, the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard. It is just that simple.<br /><br />So constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because:<br /><br />  * the colon is naturally sluggish (has decreased \"motility,\" we say)<br />  * a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces<br />  * a combination of the above two factors<br />  * there is obstruction of the lower GI tract<br />  o functional neurologic - the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation - Hirschprung disease<br />  o functional anatomic - anal-rectal positioning doesn\\'t allow easy evacuation<br />  o mechanical - a tumor physically blocks stool passage<br /><br />Breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated. This is because breast milk is such a low residue diet. Almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used. The stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions, chiefly mucus. And of course a lot of noisy gas. But these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation - just infrequent stools.<br /><br />Later, when breast feeding infants start solids, they technically can become constipated, but it is unusual in my experience. It is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue. By then we are really discussing toddlers.<br /><br />Breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often. This worries some parents. Despite reassurances to the contrary, some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled. Go figure. They forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very, very long time and it will not hurt anything.<br /><br />When the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go, another problem comes to the fore: grunting and straining. When the baby\\'s rectum forms in utero, it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months. The baby does not pass the meconium (fetal stool) in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before, during or after delivery. Until the baby is several months old, and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements, the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass. Because the baby has weak, flabby abdominal musculature (that is why his little tummy is so poochy), he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm. Just as Mom pushed during delivery, and with seemingly equal discomfort. Hence the grunting and red-faced straining.<br /><br />  The other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia, or uncoordinated stooling.<br /><br />The cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple: a gentle rectal exam with a well-lubricated pinky finger by the doctor (which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction) will be both diagnostic and curative. If one such gentle dilation doesn\\'t do the trick, I have Mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure. The anal spincter is stretched, and pretty soon, no more terrible straining.<br />Top<br /><br />Bottle fed infants are \"a whole \\'nother story.\" Infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk, and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon. (The exception to this rule in my mind is the new SimilacÂ® that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk.) So true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common; my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard.<br /><br />The young infant\\'s colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk. The residue builds up, is dried too much, and becomes hard, pebbly stool. It is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass.<br /><br />The addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist. Cereal + milk = concrete. Cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad, probably because parents don\\'t realise just how much cereal the baby is getting.<br />Top<br /><br />Treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication:<br /><br />  * Again, as with breast fed babies, a search for the cause of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders.<br />  * I use a lot of KaroÂ® corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation. It is my first choice recomendation; it almost always works if used properly. Unfortunately, many doctors and nurses don\\'t use it properly, get poor results, and don\\'t recommend it as often as they should. I start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle, regardless of size, and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going. Usually, the baby can be weaned off the Karo pretty soon, but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life. It is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water. The excess corn syrup does not get digested very well - the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula. The excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol (as below, prunes, apple juice).<br /><br />  Before scolding me about \"the risk of botulism\" from corn syrup, please see:<br /><br />  Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Volume 4,Number 3,September 2003: \"Pediatric neurologic potpourri: cases to remember\"<br /><br />  \"In the past, C. botulinum was also found in corn syrup, but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula.\"<br /><br />  For the complete source of statement, see: Olsen SJ, Swerdlow DL. Risk of infant botulism from corn syrup. In reply. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2000;19:584-5.<br /><br />  * Certain fruits and juices - for example prunes, apple juice, apricots - are rich in sorbitol, a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass. They can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation.<br />  * Lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass. We use it a lot - it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists. The dose is adjusted up or down according to respose. Side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea - obviously, stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur.<br />  * Glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just won\\'t come out easily. The suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool. Glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool, which softens it. The act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex. (Glycerine is completely safe - it is a food, found in candy, not a drug.)<br />  * Fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults, but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation, for dietary reasons: babies just don\\'t eat a lot of fiber. (I believe ISoyalacÂ®, which was a high fiber soy formula, has been discontinued. It was never very available any place I practiced, anyway.)<br /><br />Top<br /><br />Myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation:<br /><br />  * Iron in the formula causes constipation. No way. I can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations (in large doses) they may become constipated. But the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to cause any problems.<br /><br />  The irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low- or no-iron formulas.<br /><br />  * Increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended; it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic cause of the overdry stool. The problem is too little water retention in the stool, not too little water in the body! Unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar (KaroÂ®, lactulose) to retain the water in the stool, excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine.<br /><br />Top\\n',\n",

       " 'ReviewText: Just receive the noodle and try one.  The package looks similar but not the same as the one that I got from the Korean market.  I just finish the box of Shin noodle that I bought from Korean town so I know the differences right away.  I thought I got a good deal and save a trip to Korean town.  Guess not, I am wrong.  I am going to the Korean town this weekend to get the real stuff.  A little disappointed, I really want my authentic spicy red Korean Shin instant noodle tonight...<br /><br />This Shin noodle is made in the USA and it is a American version of the very popular Korean instant noodle.  This American version is only one-third as spicy and the noodle get soft and mushy very fast like the regular instant noodle.  The dry vegetable package does not go soft even after 10 minutes.  To use the dry vegs in the future, need to soak it for at least 30 minutes so the dry mushroom will get soft. The spice package is orange color, the real Korean Shin noodle is bright red in color and the noodle will not get mushy after 10 minutes.  I think it is something to do with the red pepper that the Korean use and not the picante in this USA version.  It is spicy but taste totally different than the Korean kind of red pepper which make it so special.<br /><br />Really want to return it but since I got it with the lightning deal discount, I will eat it like regular instant noodle to save the hazzle.  So beware if anyone reading this is Korean or have tried the real Korean Shin instant noodle.  This is not the real thing, do not order this and do not pay full price for this American version of the Shin noodle.  Before I was skeptical when reading some of the reviews with only 1 star, now I know they are right.\\n',\n",

I've eaten Ramen Noodles for quite some time and have found them to be a super inexpensive meal at .10 a package and sometimes cheaper.  I also like other readers mentioned don't always use the entire seasoning packet because of the high sodium content.  I found these noodles to have even higher sodium content.  Which I guess isn't too bad if you don't plan on eating the soup.<br />These noodles to me tasted just about the same as Ramen Noodles except the noodles were a tid bit larger in size.  If we are reviewing just the flavor packet, I would say it was pretty good.  Especially for those who like spice like myself.  I am use to eating super spicy foods and have a high tolerance to spice.  So they were right on par with what I am use to as far as the heat goes.  But I can see someone who doesn't eat spicy foods to find the seasoning super hot and spicy for them.  I like the idea of the dehydrated veggies that are enclosed to accompany the seasoning.  I am giving these noodles 3 stars because they are just overpriced Ramen in my opinion.  Plus the sodium content in the noodles is just unacceptable.  They surely can come up with lower sodium options. And lastly I give it 3 stars because of the price.  I would not expect to pay more than .50 cents a package for these noodles in a retail store. I would definitely buy these again but not in bulk.\\n\",\n",

The noodles are your regular, fried ramen...a tad thicker then common grocery store noodles.  One trick I use is after cooking the noodles, I rinse with water well...it takes that starchy flavor away that I don't care for and makes a fresher tasting soup.  The heat of this is strong, use a quarter packet to start, you can always build up.  Not much more flavor going on except the heat of the chili.<br /><br />I do love the Hoo Roo Rook noodles; they aren't fried and the noodles are round to fit your saucepan.  They aren't in the same heat category as these noodles, but they are nice for a more 'tender' palate that likes things not-so-spicy.<br /><br />*NEWSFLASH*  Okay, I'm coming to the end of this box of Spicy Picante and realized that I would sort of miss having my mouth burning while eating soup this winter...so on that note, I just may buy this noodle again -- it's a heat that kind of grows on you.  I did order the spicy seafood flavor and will see how that one goes.  All in all, this is an acquired hotness that takes getting used to if you're not used to heat (like me).\\n\",\n",

You can boil dumplings with it. You can throw in any type of meat with it. You can add in beaten eggs for a different soup texture, or just crack an egg right into the soup before or after cooking depending on how cooked you want your egg to be. Add milk to the soup if you want a more milky flavour. Add a few slices of cheese on top after it's prepared and enjoy the melted cheesy deliciousness. You can also add literally any type of vegetable you can think of. If you're not feeling like having noodles with that soup base you can use the noodles with your own broth or make fried noodles. Then you can save the soup base for seasoning any future dishes you make.<br /><br />These noodles make for some really flexible meals when you're tight on time or ingredients.

It is great just the way the package tells you to eat it. Sometimes, I'll just make it by pouring hot water over it, and the noodles are still a little crispy that way. You can also make this really fancy. Stir in a can of tuna (flavored or not!), some vegetables, leftover meat of any kind...you can make this into a really great and filling meal! I just wouldn't recommend adding rotisserie chicken (that was the saltiest thing I think I've ever eaten...).<br /><br />I love this stuff and I don't think I'll ever stop eating it. The price on Amazon is alright -- if you have an Asian market nearby, it is cheaper there.

To preserve the original spicy flavor, the egg should be hard-boiled in the soup. But some prefers to blend the soft yolk to the soup for a milder taste. There are a lot of people who blend the whole egg to the soup during cooking, this makes it a wholly different kind. Note, as more egg blends into the soup, you are more inclined to finish the whole soup, which is not too great for your health (too much sodium).<br />2.

I love spicy foods and not only does this satisfy my craving, but it's also full of flavor. The possibilities are endless when it comes to adding ingredients to this ramyun, but even if there is nothing added, it is still very good. I really like the packet of freeze dried vegetables that come with it. I have half a box left and I already know that I will be ordering more if I can't find something similiar in the grocery stores in my area.<br /><br />To address the sodium issue - yes, there is about half your days worth of sodium in one flavoring packet, BUT you most likely won't be able to handle the heat of one whole packet so you won't be consuming the full amount of contained sodium and if you do use the entire packet, just watch your sodium intake the rest of the day and double your water intake (you will probably do that anyway to cool your mouth from the heat, but it's a good burn :)). These aren't incredibly healthy. My boyfriend and I usually split one because there is a lot of noodles per package and it is so filling. You do not want to eat this for several days in a row, but a lot of things are okay in moderation. I whole heartedly believe that one package of these noodles is a heck of a lot healthier than anything offered at a fast food chain.\\n\",\n",

The cooking instruction is for full bag, so it\\'s fair to note the nutrition contents for the whole bag as below:<br /><br />Calories: 560<br />Calories from fat: 160<br /><br />Total Fat: 18g, 28% of daily value<br />Saturated Fat: 9g, 46% of daily value<br />Sodium: 2080mg, 86% of daily value<br /><br />While the sodium content is on the higher end of foods, you have some control over this by adjusting the amount of power soup base.  Once I learned the nutritional facts, I use the full bag of noodles with half packet of the soup base.  The other method would be to cook the whole bag as usual, but immediately throw away 1/2 the soup to avoid the temptation of eating the whole thing.<br /><br />Lastly, my secret to best ramen is no secret to Koreans - after the noodle is dropped in boiling water for 1 minute, drop an egg and sliced spring onions and cook for 1 more minute.  Then, pour into a bowl by 3rd minute.  You\\'ll know you did this correctly when the noodle in the bowl is \"almost\" 100% cooked where the noodle have come apart, but still somewhat undercooked.  If you cook more than 4 minutes as instructed on the bag, then the noodles will get bloated and taste nasty by the time it makes it to the table.<br /><br />Enjoy!\\n',\n",

I haven't found any other ramen that I like as much as this.<br /><br />Most ramen I eat as drained noodles sprinkled with the seasoning packet, but this one is much better as a soup.  The seasoning is far too spicy to eat these noodles dry, but the seasoning packet is perfect for seasoning soup.  Other types of ramen don't make the kind of flavorful soup that this one makes, but there is enough flavor in one packet of this stuff to flavor a LOT of water!<br /><br />A word of warning... this soup is VERY spicy.  I regularly eat hot wings, spicy potato chips, and I put extra hot sauce in spicy chili.  I like spicy food.  But this stuff is pretty harsh.  If you're very sensitive to spicy foods, I would avoid this one.  If you're mildly sensitive to spicy foods, just use a little extra water in the soup.  I wouldn't say this stuff is over-the-top spicy, but it has a pretty strong kick.<br /><br />I think the thing I like most about this type of ramen is how flavorful the noodles themselves are, even when they are made as a soup.  When I make ramen as a soup with other types, the noodles are almost flavorless.  But these noodles really soak up the flavoring very well.<br /><br />The one complaint I have is that I don't care for the vegetables that come in the vegetable packet.  Fortunately, they are separate, so I just don't put them in.  I find that they don't get soft enough, and I don't like the texture or flavor of the vegetables.\\n\",\n",

I had fond memories of rice and noodle concoctions from my student days and I was drawn to these because of the many excellent reviews.  Indeed, after reading some, I fully expected my toes to tingle after eating these!  :)<br /><br />At first I really liked them, and yes, they are truly spicy.  I like spicy.  The spicier the better.  Besides, the reviewers are right- you can just put in as much of the spice packet as you want.  After a few of them, though, it occurred to me that the spicy wasn't like any Thai or Cambodian food I've had, or even straight up hot chilies like habaneros; the spice struck me as more chemical-induced.  Was it the MSG?  The other salts?  Whatever it is, it doesn't settle well with these taste buds.<br /><br />The more I ate, the less good they seemed to me.  After a while, I noticed that they always left kind of a gummy, coated feeling to the inside of my mouth.  Then I looked at the ingredients.... Maybe it is all the MSG, or maybe the beef tallow, or maybe all the sodium variants that I can't even pronounce.  Whatever it is, these are losing their appeal with every serving.  Now, I'm not a health foodie and despite the fact that one package doses you with 88% of daily value of sodium and 40% daily value of fat, I'm not holding that against it.  (to be fair, the previous amounts assume that you use the entire spice packet and each package counts as 2 servings)  It really comes down to that gummy feeling left in my mouth after eating a package, even using 1/3 of the spice packet.  I just can't get past that.<br /><br />The noodles seem like any other ramen noodles, and they are yummy.  It's also nice that they have a decent size packet of dehydrated veggies inside, separate from the spices.<br /><br />Taste is totally about preference, and I don't think this is a bad product just because it didn't work for me.  Also, I think they are priced right, especially if bought through subscribe and save.  I've got to go with my experience on the rating, though.  Though I won't be getting these again, I wouldn't steer people away.  I would suggest, though, first looking at the ingredients list to see if you are cool with what's in it, and also get a few to try before committing to a bulk buy.\\n\",\n",

There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann's becomes too thick and gluey.\\n\",\n",

Tastes great!\\nReviewText: The variety packs taste great!<br /><br />I have them every morning. At $0.30 cents per meal, I don't understand why everyone on earth isn't buying this stuff up.<br /><br />Maple and brown sugar is terrific, followed by apples and cinnamon, followed by regular. You don't get tired of the same ole thing, and they taste great.<br /><br />I just boil water from a small pot, empty the packet or 2 in a bowl, pour in boiling water, and watch it expand to 2x its size!<br /><br />Taste really good and takes minutes to prepare.<br /><br />Not sure why everyone on earth isn't this. Convenient, healthy, very quick, excellent quality, and extremely cheap...\\n\",\n",

It\\'s all good, that\\'s for sure, and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular.<br />  This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored, as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann\\'s and other well-known oatmeals. What I personally like about McCann\\'s is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.<br />  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you\\'ll end up with six ten-count boxes. This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if you\\'re a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal.\\n',\n",

WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!\\nReviewText: Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I\\'d found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I\\'d eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart\\'s content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you\\'re like me, ... it\\'s not you ...it\\'s the maltitol!\\n',\n",

I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured \"food\" items.  I really don\\'t think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it\\'s own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don\\'t use any low-fat milk. Or don\\'t add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.\\n',\n",

After experimenting with various types of food, I have found she loves natural balance.  What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties.  I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it.  Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not.  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...<br /><br />Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.  I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save $20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon.<br /><br />All in all, I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food.  While I have never eaten it, my dog seems to love it.\\n\",\n",

I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).<br /><br />Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays \"NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS\" (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays \"CAFFENE FREE\".  So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not.  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it.\\n',\n",

The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor's request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he's eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this for now, but stay tuned.<br /><br />I'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but he's just a big cat who doesn't exercise much, let's face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she's so healthy. She's tiny, but happy and agile.

I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters.\\n\",\n",

It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top, before serving. I couldn\\'t believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast, for three days. The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling. The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake. The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor. Pair the cake with your morning coffee and you\\'ve got the perfect breakfast treat!\\n',\n",

The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned.  Our friends couldn't discern any difference from classic CCCs.  The texture, body, and elasticity (meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other gluten-free flours) is nice and chewy -- the same as CCCs made with regular flour.  And an added bonus -- the high protein and fiber level (I calculate 2-3 g fiber/cookie) fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower.<br /><br />I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it.\\n\",\n",

I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something \"strawberry\" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively \"healthy\" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I\\'ve also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it\\'s still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You\\'ll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.\\n',\n",

The mintiness is just not strong, and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis. I\\'m not a dragon-breath person, but still, one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath. Four or five will freshen my breath for a short while - maybe 15 minutes.

These 2 boy cats are not picky eaters. They loved the Purina. They loved the Nutro. They loved the Iams. They love whatever we feed them.<br /><br />This review is based on what we, their affectionate owners love. After a certain age, we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods- and lower carb foods, because the catties were fatties. We tried a few types of food. Some evinced no change. Some made the litter super-stink.  Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didn\\'t have to chew it to swallow it...<br /><br />This Felidae has done the trick. No problems to speak of. It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose. The cats love it. The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing. And here\\'s the kicker:<br />After feeding the cats Felidae, their demeanor improved. Their coats are super soft and lush- both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food. We\\'re now loyal Felidae consumers.<br /><br />Additionally, the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with cat-allergies.\\n',\n",

She's now been on just the Felidae for about ten days now, off the old food entirely, and she is a much sweeter, happier cat. I think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested, or something. In any case, I am a happy purchaser of Felidae. I don't agree with the previous reviewer that cats don't like it.

However, the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really \"feeling better\" since we changed their food to Felidae.  Even Prissy, the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her, where before when she was on Purina One, all she wanted to do was to sleep.<br /><br />I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems, it\\'ll be more effective.<br /><br />However, the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life.\\n',\n",

Cats do not like change when it comes to their food.  And they just had to change it without putting it on their label.  We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell.  (As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae, and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues.)<br /><br />Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home.  If cats get \"upset\" because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating.  It depends on the cat.  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight.  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal.  It has been a year since then and they are better.  Then the formula for this food changed.<br /><br />We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us.  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food.  It wasn\\'t until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick.  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven\\'t suffered one bit like our dogs have.<br /><br />Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating.  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it!  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats, none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula.<br /><br />I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal.  As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals, and tell me not to buy it.  This is just horrible!\\n',\n",

It definitely makes you sweat a bit when you're eating it. It was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but I don't think I would buy it again due to the heat. We prefer the milder McCormick's brand of Fajita mix. I've also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasn't as spicy as this mix is.<br /><br />If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind. To me it was more than medium hot but not by too much.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and it's versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it. You take a plastic bag, a couple of tbs of vegetable oil, 1/4 cup water and mix the seasoning, water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes. In the meantime, it says to stir fry your veggies (peppers and onion) but I found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and I don't think it affected quality or taste. I also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil.<br /><br />I have one more package of this to use and next time I'm going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more.\\n\",\n",

This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home.<br /><br />Let me just say this, I have had small dogs before. Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when they're sitting on our laps but, you know. They're dogs.<br /><br />When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon. It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco. But, they continued to have gas. I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony.<br /><br />Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long. Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow. Much better. Granted, they don't like it as much, but we humans like it a whole lot better.\\n\",\n",

I've always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea, with enough aroma and taste, and beautiful reddish color, perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own, but a decent base for mixes.<br />This tea, however, is nothing of the sort. Freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell, and the brewed tea is weak, flat and tasteless.  Somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore. So, you get a lot of tea for the money, but the quality is such that you might as well drink Lipton bags, they are not that much worse.\\n\",\n",

Most energy drinks cannot be made w/ out a high dosage of caffeine. I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b/c they contain too much caffeine and/or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.<br /><br />Now you're NOT sensitive to caffeine, then it's a great buy. It's not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It's not loaded w/ a bunch of chemicals like 5-Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours. Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body/weight.<br /><br />Side note - if you want to feel energized during the day, have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy, fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy!\\n\",\n",

My most recent purchase, however, was disappointing. The sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe 1/4th of the regular size. Having large crystals was something I always really liked about Sugar in the Raw. It enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes. I called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar. They have had many complaints of a similar nature. This, they claimed, also reduced the crystal size. They said this problem should go away with their newer crop. The representative said that the new-crop sugar will have a 6-10 digit date code (without ANY spaces) that ends with a \"1\" and no letters. The trailing digits are a date code using the Julian calendar. (My recent bad-purchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a \"51A\"). Bottom line: their current product is not much better than much cheaper products. When they get a better crop, I\\'ll go back to purchasing Sugar in the Raw.\\n',\n",

It's taste is not the greatest, but it's a 2.5 oz. shot, and it's gone in a second. It tastes, more or less, like a concentrated sweet tea. For the record, I've had 5 hour energy, and that tastes FAR worse. I will put up the taste for the results. It's got 150mg of caffeine, which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters. I can't stand sucralose and sugar substitutes, and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it. The sugar is at 9g, which isn't horrible. I used to drink 4 16oz. Red Bulls a day for the caffeine, and this gives me far better energy, and is much more subtle. My preference is black coffee, but I can't drink 8-12 cups a day anymore. Overall, Steaz does it right; real organic ingredients in moderate amounts, and they create big results.\\n\",\n",

The drink is delicious -- I can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice, like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea. I am very sensitive to sucralose (Splenda) which is in so many energy drinks these days; I also hate the taste. I love that Steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners. The rush it gives me is slow and even. I have several medical conditions, including fibromyalgia, which saps me of energy and causes intense pain. I like how Steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so I can get things done. No caffeine jitters, even though there are 150 mg of caffeine in each bottle.<br />It was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores, so I started looking online for a bulk price.

I usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee, but with these it is easy for me to cut down on the sweetness because I won't allow myself more than 2 creamers per cup. I think this is definitely the best option for buying creamers from Amazon since all the other listings have a lot of complaints about creamers breaking in shipping!\\n\",\n",

I couldn't believe how many reviews I read about coffee creamer cups; but many of the Amazon creamer options (both Coffeemate and International Delight) had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packaging.<br /><br />That was not an issue here. The shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each (as shown in the photo); those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes. Thus, none of my cups were broken, no waste and no sloppy drippy mess. Plus the four boxes means I could put one in the kitchen, one in the bathroom (we moved our mini Keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen Keurig - best idea my husband ever had), and one at work, with a reserve for whichever runs out first.<br /><br />If you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like I was by the negative packaging reviews on other options, this is your best bet. As a bonus, the auto delivery price is very reasonable.\\n\",\n",

Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand. I\\'d never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee. We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least. I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I\\'d give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely. And I\\'m glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee. It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried). I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods. Almost. All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn\\'t anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we\\'ve been able to test out. When we run out of all the pods we\\'ve accumulated, I\\'ll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn\\'t completely disappointing I\\'ll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE\">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you\\'re looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!\\n',\n",

They were mostly large pieces, re-hydrated well and had good flavor. I'd estimate about 25% of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces, most likely due to the shaking about in transit. Not a problem since I sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes. There was a small amount (perhaps an ounce or so) of very small/minced-size/dust-like pieces. Still useful to add into gravies and the like. Nothing gets wasted!<br /><br />The label says it is a product of China and Italy. Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country.<br /><br />I'm quite fond of dried mushrooms. While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones, the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus. Additionally, I find the broth used to re-hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews. To save time and add flavor, I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re-hydrating them. Really helps meld all the flavors together. I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta. The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroom-infused water.<br /><br />This was the first time I used the Roland brand (got it on a price dip from the Amazon Warehouse), and would certainly buy them again. Highly recommend.\\n\",\n",

When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.  These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.<br /><br />The New York Cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them.  You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!<br /><br />Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.<br /><br />Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.

I've found that going beyond the simply-flavored chips, like cheddar or vinegar, usually results in disappointment.  Tried the Thai or asian-inspired chips by Target, Archer Farms, and they were awful.  These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome...so much so, that I'm considering buying them in bulk from Amazon.  The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate.  The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip...sweet, salty, spicy.  Was sour in there too?  I don't know, but this is a well-made well-balanced chip that is addicting.\\n\",\n",

It's easy to go through half of a bag without stopping.  The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination.  I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great.\\n\",\n",

Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard.\\n\",\n",

I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  \"What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes \"cheaper\". I don\\'t know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.\"  I did receive a reply: \"Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the \"best before\" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase!

Please let me know if I can be of any more help.\"  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the \"bad\" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same...\\n',\n",

The quantity of salt used is the optimum which is required.<br /><br />Although they say serving size 1 ounce, you will finish the whole packet in no time. Total calories is 300 for 2 ounce bag. This is slightly on the higher side. But still it is ok, as they have not compromised on the taste.<br /><br />Only issue was that all packets have some burnt chips, which taste bad. Kettle should take care when packing to ensure no burnt chips are there.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon to get 24 bags for just 12 bucks with free shipping using their coupon.\\n',\n",

Specifically, the \"One Star\" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.<br /><br />WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.<br /><br />Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.<br />But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it\\'s deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we\\'re all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of \"United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers\"....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the \"Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum\"! : )<br /><br />I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a \"Potato Chip Diet\".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I\\'d like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I\\'ve taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn\\'t like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!<br /><br />Flavoured potato PERFECTION!\\n',\n",

Some of their flavors are nauseating.  With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips.  Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I can\\'t recommend these chips enough.  You won\\'t regret it.<br /><br />Some people say they are burnt but they aren\\'t.  From their website: \"Take a quick look and you\\'ll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag\"<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: \"At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are \"trans fat free\" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.\"  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.  I\\'m also a fan of their unsalted potato chips.  For those of us watching our salt intake, the unsalted chips is the best you can get.  Period.\\n',\n",

I searched all over my part of Alabama (the northwestern part of the state) and could not find them.

Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I\\'m proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven\\'t experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don\\'t have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4\">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM\">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, \"...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.\"\\n',\n",

It sat on my shelf and I forgot about it. Last weekend I tasted a Zevia cream soda and was not pleased with the flavor, it tasted weird and smokey like the LorAnn oil I had gotten.  I tried to doctor up the soda with a little SF Vanilla Torani syrup and a tablespoon of heavy cream - IT TASTED AMAZING!!!  The odd smokiness was gone and it had a wonderful rich mouthfeel.<br /><br />So I wanted to see if this would help the LorAnn oil too.  I put a cup of whipping cream in a bowl and added a teaspoon of vanilla and tasted it, it tasted fine.  Then I added ONE DROP of the oil, it is very strong, and stirred it in - IT TASTED SO MUCH BETTER!  I whipped it up and put it on fruit and it was such a treat.<br /><br />Now I will always whip a drop of it with vanilla into desserts and whip cream.  It was such a happy accident to find out how to use it.  When added to vanilla it really adds a new depth of flavor and tastes so different than just out of the bottle or on its own in cream.<br /><br />It is VERY potent so only use a drop and increase after tasting, if you add too much it will ruin the recipe so use a light touch.\\n',\n",

The problem with the two liter size is that it takes one person (me) too long to drink it, letting it go flat.<br /><br />In any case, Vernor's is unique in that it is aged in oak for three years, I think.

It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor\\'s is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor\\'s is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can\\'t find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor\\'s Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is \"The Vernor\\'s Story: From Gnomes to Now\" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company\\'s marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor\\'s fans.\\n',\n",

I use Madhava\\'s agave nectar in my baked goods all the time, and am always pleased with the results. At the time I\\'m writing this, Amazon was out of stock as a vendor. However, when it was in stock, it was priced well for the 2-pack.<br /><br />Other than baking, I\\'ve used it to top waffles, pancakes, and in small doses (1/2 teaspoon) added it to oatmeal. A little goes a long way.<br /><br />Using agave nectar: Use 1/3 to 1/2 less agave nectar than you would another sweetener (depending on your taste and the recipe. Recipes with dried fruit need much less), cut the heat in the oven by 25 degrees F; if there is oil in the recipe, cut it by 1/3 (alternately, use a tablespoon or two of sifted coconut flour to absorb more of the liquid -- just don\\'t use too much or your recipe will be dry). Additionally, when baking, make sure to mix it with the wet ingredients prior to adding it to the dry. Most bakers might already know this, but remember to read recipes first because sugar is typically added with dry ingredients (unless beaten with butter first).<br /><br />Agave nectar does not crystalize like other sugars do, so you won\\'t be able to substitute it for corn syrup in making hard candy. However, I highly recommend it for baking. It makes everything moister.<br /><br />If you are looking for less caramel flavor, you\\'ll need to use the light version of this product (equally good in all applications).\\n',\n",

The true flavor is present, and it satisifies the need for something salty, sweet, spicy, and crunchy.  A++++\\n',\n",

Horrible experience, bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever.

By the time we were done decorating, we knew there was no way we could feed this mess to our family. So we ended up going to the store anyway to buy a pre-made cake.

The proportion of liquids to meat was fair too, it\\'s not one of those with a spoonful of meat and the rest is liquid either, though it does all need to be cooked and shrinks quite a bit due to high fat content in the meat. None of the meat was seasoned, at all. This is very helpful as the meat can be used with any flavoring. There is a mild \"spam\"-like texture and taste to the meats(but way better than spam any day), almost a brine or something, that\\'s why I heavily seasoned it. Don\\'t plan on frying anything in the fat from these meats, it gave everything a slightly rancid, soury taste...no idea why!

Mainly good as unique gift.\\nReviewText: This is pretty good regular style soy sauce.  But it is not super-wonderful-better than any other good quality soy sauce you can buy in an Asian market.  The main value is as a unique gift.<br />  In the Japanese soy sauce world, there are 4 types: regular, mild (usukuchi), for raw fish (sashimi) and light colored.  Bluegrass soy sauce is regular style.  Compared to Kikoman (a good commercial brand that is widely available) Bluegrass starts saltier, is flat in the middle, then ends with a complex & interesting flavor.  Kikoman is less salty initially and has a round, full flavor in the middle.  Doesn't have the complex ending flavors.  For me, the initial saltiness of Bluegrass is a minus and Kikoman's full middle flavor is a plus.  I prefere Kikoman, especially for dipping sushi where the flavor is more direct.  But I lived in Japan for many years and am used to the standard Japanese flavor.  I haven't tried Bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor, which is how soy sauce is usually used.<br />  Bluegrass is a perfectly good soy sauce.  Each brand has a different flavor and everyone has their favorite.  If you want a unique Kentucky gift for an Asian friend, this is different than the standard bottle of Bourbon or box of chocolate.\\n\",\n",

I will buy it again because it\\'s a nice, mellow blend, and my favorite daily coffee, Nabob, must now be shipped from Canada. However, on my first order to the Canadian company, it\\'s taking a long time to be delivered (still haven\\'t gotten it).<br /><br />The reason for only three stars is not about the quality of the coffee but the fact that the description of the product does not mention the fact that this \"Kona coffee\" is actually only 15% Kona. If you look very carefully at the photo of the disc, you can see that information, and there\\'s a legal disclaimer saying that the product may not match exactly with the description. So it\\'s my fault for not reading more carefully, but I was happy to see what I thought was 100% Kona and wasn\\'t careful. I\\'ve bought the 15% Kona before in a local store and did know that there was such a product in the Tassimo discs, but I just read the product title and ordered.<br /><br />As I said, the coffee tastes good, the amount of coffee is the usual amount, neither the small cups of some European coffees or the extra large size, and I would recommend the coffee. Just be aware that this is blended coffee with only 15% Kona. And don\\'t expect it to come in a flash, as it did when Amazon Prime delivered it.\\n',\n",

The caramel is liquid and complements the Ghiradelli chocolate perfectly. Do not try this brew if you are attempting to lose weight - you will end up an addict like me.<br />  The Ghiradelli product is far better than the Caramello/Hershey product in every way. The Caramello chocolate lacks the refined taste of the Ghiradelli squares, and the Caramello caramel is harder and not as sublime in taste. Comparing the two is like comparing Warren Buffett to myself in terms of wealth. Unfortunately I am the Caramello bar in this regard.<br />  At the very least try the Ghiradelli.\\n',\n",

It brings out the natural sweetness of its malty, slightly floral style.  I just bought another two pounds.\\n\",\n",

The sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind, dipped in chocolate, with one end left just normal cracker to you don't get your fingers covered in chocolate while eating.<br /><br />Here's some of the nitty gritty details - each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets, that contain probably 20 or so of the sticks.  The packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love Japanese product design!  :)  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top.<br /><br />Each of the packets has 210 calories (90 from fat), and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.  It does contain milk, wheat, soybeans and sheanut - so if any of these are an issue for you, then you'll want to pass.  It also says on the packaging that the facility they're manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts - the product doesn't use either of them, but the disclosure is nice if you're particularly sensitive to either.<br /><br />Overall a great snack at a great price - the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets, so that's quite a few snacks.  One note, if you live in a hot climate, don't order them in the summer because they will melt together (in shipping)!  Duh!  :)\\n\",\n",

I had heard many people rave about a Japanese snack called Pocky so I figured I would try it out. Just like the description states, its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate. I wouldn\\'t say the taste is mind boggling but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess, well, as long as the chocolate doesn\\'t melt. Anyways, in case anyone is wondering, I ordered from a seller named Very asia (amazon.com/gp/help/seller/at-a-glance.html?ie=UTF8&isAmazonFulfilled=0&orderID=103-7071944-5595443&marketplaceSeller=1&seller=A3JW437I54SEI1). I believe it took around a 3 weeks to actually get to me (maybe it had to be imported) but when it did, it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever. I\\'m definitely considering re-stocking on this in the future if I can\\'t find a local store<br /><br />EDIT: Oct 11, 2012<br /><br />*****Inquire the type of pocky from seller before finalizing purchase*****<br /><br />So I decided to restock after I couldn\\'t fight the craving anymore. Unfortunately the batch this time was not so good (ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through Amazon Prime). What I received was not the picture shown on the front page (2 per pack japanese pocky), it was a 1 per pack pocky~ish thing from Thailand. In my opinion, the 1 giant pack compared to 2 smaller packs is definitely a step back. Packaging was fine and I ordered in October when the weather was a bit cooler aka no melted chocolate arriving at the front door. The sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste, more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate. The original Japanese pocky melted almost immediately in your mouth, this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouth.<br /><br />Personally I like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a pocky flavor. I also have terrible self control so I buy things that come in small portions in order to a) not eat everything at once and b) avoid making the fridge a mess by cluttering it with tons of opened items. I can honestly say that I won\\'t be overeating when it comes to this batch of pocky because I and my stomach dislike it so much. I won\\'t change my original rating because that still holds true for the Japanese pocky but if I were to rate only the Thailand pocky it would be a 3. The taste isn\\'t \"terrible\" but its definitely not to my liking. If possible I will be uploading some pictures of what I received.\\n',\n",

I discovered these snacks at an anime convention (though I\\'d heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them). They are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff (the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels) that have a charming tiny popping crispness. The chocolate flavor, a nice non-bitter, non-dark, generically pleasing choco-taste, seems to be the most popular (given how fast they sell out at cons), but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream. Very nice.<br /><br />This is by no means a health food (it\\'s in the same category as a cookie, it\\'s got fat and sugar and non-healthful ingredients). But hey, it\\'s junk food. We all know it\\'s supposed to be OCCASIONAL and not habitual in the diet. Unless you\\'re really prone to binge-eating or can\\'t stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number. 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat, 3 of them saturated. I wouldn\\'t recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes. In fact, just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effect.<br /><br />If you love the flavor of coconut-chocolate together (like Almond Joy) try the coconut chocolate ones. They\\'re really so good, oh man. Hubby says the taste reminds him of the Girl Scout \\'caramel delights\" cookies which are, in turn, similar to the old Yes Yes cookies (from the seventies or so).<br /><br />Anyway, if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick-looking treats, or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats, this is what they were eating. :) Fun treats.<br /><br />However, with this crazy hot summer, I\\'d recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until fall\\'s cooler weather. You might get a sticky, clumped mess of Pocky sticks in this deep summer weather. (Look for local stores that specialize in Japanese anime or manga and they\\'ll likely carry Japanese snacks like these. In South Florida, Tate\\'s Comics has them in a variety of flavors..and FRESH and NOT MELTED).\\n',\n",

Then when you unwrap the bar you find they are only about 60% the length of a \"normal\" snack bar. The rest of it is empty air inside the wrapper. If they were to not include wrappers those 5 bars would occupy less than 25% of the space inside the box.<br /><br />As far as taste goes they are so-so. On the dry side with a hint of berry flavor. Celiacs, who are used to inferior products, won\\'t be disappointed in the taste of this one.<br /><br />I\\'ve also had their cookies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packaging. The picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cookie. But when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding cookies about the size of a quarter.<br /><br />I really want to like this company. They seem to be trying hard and coming out with new products and keeping allergens out of the production process. That is why I\\'ve continued to try their products. I bought their granola many times, always wanting to like it, but it is some of the worst food I\\'ve ever had.

I want to love these bars and I love everything the company stands for (and actually really like their cookies), but something has changed with these bars and they are just not even appetizing.  I hope they address the issue and I will certainly try them again if they do something to enhance the taste and address the issue with the texture. A total bummer -  they were better in the past but something changed with the taste, along with their new packaging!!\\n\",\n",

The boxes are now a plain, generic design..you know, the kind all brands change to when they want to make their products look cheaper. I then compared the ingredients of the new shipment with the older boxes I still had at home. Guess what?! Cheaper ingredients! Next, I taste-tested, and let my 3 year old help. He wouldn't eat the new ones...and I can't blame him. They are oily and bland. I thought Enjoy Life was a brand that actually cared about using quality ingredients to make a good-tasting product. I was wrong. In summary, these are way too expensive to be made with low-quality, unpalatable ingredients.\\n\",\n",

So when I stumbled upon this at my local Whole Foods, I was very excited to try it.<br /><br />Overall, I really like them.  It's got pretty good texture, taste and heft.  It's not so dense that you want to gag after two bites but also not so light that you can eat the whole box (which really isn't that big).<br /><br />I know alot of people complain about the size/packaging and I agree somewhat.  But each bar is an ounce and 120 calories... on par with many other breakfast bars.  I like the Berry flavor the best, it's the closest to real, non FA specialty flavor. Overally, I'm grateful for these bars because now I can tote several in my diaper bag and car and know that when I really need a quick snack, I won't be left stranded.\\n\",\n",

About the size of a gum-ball, these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower. They are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this tea.<br /><br />Decorative does not mean tasteless. As a white tea, the flavor is mild, but rich and soothing. The jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea. I have had stronger jasmine teas, but this one is quite balanced and tasty. I used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than 7 yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade. The white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and don\\'t get bitter if seeped for long periods.<br /><br />I must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels. Pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart, though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact. Some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf. Better packaging might solve this.<br /><br />If you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells, or are entertaining and want a conversation piece, then Numi Tea Flower Jewel should be on your short list.\\n',\n",

Its not the case. Honestly, I do make it most of the time, but some days, you just don't have the time/energy to get it all done. Enter this product. Before I bought this baby food, I read the reviews and all these people were saying that it has fruit in it, its like a dessert, yadda yadda yadda. The truth is, is that yes, it has a bit of fruit in it, but its not sweet at all. The fruit merely brings out the flavors naturally so that you don't have to add anything else. Its a great product to enter proteins into baby's diet. The consistency is smooth enough that if you wanted to add cereal  to it also, baby will not choke on it. I highly recommend.\\n\",\n",

The flavor is just right, not too sweet or too savory, and doesn't have a strong chicken flavor. Almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp, thus it's a very good first protein to offer, and good for picky eaters. My nephews and my niece also liked this flavor, so it's a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you don't know a particular baby's preferences.<br />Something I wish I had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other Stage 2 Earth's Best, especially for having chicken. I added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture, and she liked that just fine, but it is an extra step. However the runnier texture makes it workable for younger babies or those with gagging/texture problems.\\n\",\n",

I purchased Breezy Morning Sassafrass tea and although was quite good it was very expensive for only 20 average size tea bags and shipping was as much as the product.  Not a good bargain.

So I started looking in grocery stores and online for it in a teabag form.  After several weeks of investigation I called the restaurant and asked what they used to make the tea.  I was told is was Pappy's Sassafras Concentrate.  I looked online and found it at Amazon.com.  As I was ordering it I also saw the Sassafras Teabags.  I thought I'd order a box to try.  I was very dissapointed.  It didn't taste like the flat rootbeer I was expecting.  It was more like black licorice, which I hate, with a very mild rootbeer undertone.  It also didn't have the distinctive red color that you get by steeping the sassafras root.<br /><br />I've never had real Sassafras tea made with the root so I don't know if the teabags are more like the real thing or not.  Bottom line:  I won't buy the teabags again.\\n\",\n",

For example, if you order these in April and the batch you receive has a June \"use by\" date, it may be a stretch to consume the 300 bags before the seeds start going rancid on you.  Since they\\'re roasted in oil and unsalted, these seeds may spoil more readily than the salted variety, even if refrigerated upon receipt.<br /><br />Amazon doesn\\'t seem to specify \"use by\" dates for the food products they sell, so it\\'s a gamble for the purchaser.  I\\'m assuming that Amazon won\\'t ship stuff that has \"expired\", but they probably ship out the oldest stock first, and the \"use by\" date on the item may not be what you would select if you had a choice.\\n',\n",

I really enjoy the Starbucks VIA instant coffee - but I drink so much, it is rather expensive so I thought I would give this a try.  Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with the taste.  I don't think it equals fresh brewed but it is very acceptable.  I bought my first 38 pack at my local grocery store for about $7.  That seemed a little high but I figured I would check online to find the best price.  As I started calculating all of the online prices, they are charging about $7 bucks for the 19 count.  I would suggest that you check your local grocery stores as you might be able to find it cheaper.  So you don't have to do the math...$7 / 38 = .184 per single.  Online price $27 / 114 = .236 (shipping not calculated in).  Looking at a supposed discount coffee supplier, you can get a case of 12 boxes for $69, no sales tax and free shipping...sounds like a great deal??  12 x 19 = 228 singles so $69 / 228 = .302 per single - the most expensive at all.\\n\",\n",

Like the other low star reviewer, I got suckered by seeing 'habenero' in the name and the 12 oz size. Some people might like the flavor, citrus-y and it has some fish sauce in the mix (according to the ingredient label), but if you're looking for hot this ain't it\\n\",\n",

Plastic bottle.  It does have a convenient squirt top.  But overall, not very hot or tasty, and made mostly from jalape&ntilde;os.  If I had seen the ingredients list I would not have bought it:<br />Jalapenos<br />Water<br />Vinegar<br />Brown Sugar<br />Lime Juice<br />Fish Sauce<br />Cilantro<br />Habanero<br />Garlic<br />Spice Blend<br />Salt<br />Potassium Sorbate<br />Xanthan Gum\\n',\n",

       " ' pocky is just plain fun to eat. i discovered these snacks at an anime convention (though i\\'d heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them). they are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff (the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels) that have a charming tiny popping crispness. the chocolate flavor, a nice non-bitter, non-dark, generically pleasing choco-taste, seems to be the most popular (given how fast they sell out at cons), but i prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream. very nice.<br /><br />this is by no means a health food (it\\'s in the same category as a cookie, it\\'s got fat and sugar and non-healthful ingredients). but hey, it\\'s junk food. we all know it\\'s supposed to be occasional and not habitual in the diet. unless you\\'re really prone to binge-eating or can\\'t stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number. 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat, 3 of them saturated. i wouldn\\'t recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes. in fact, just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effect.<br /><br />if you love the flavor of coconut-chocolate together (like almond joy) try the coconut chocolate ones. they\\'re really so good, oh man. hubby says the taste reminds him of the girl scout \\'caramel delights\" cookies which are, in turn, similar to the old yes yes cookies (from the seventies or so).<br /><br />anyway, if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick-looking treats, or seen footage of cute japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats, this is what they were eating.
